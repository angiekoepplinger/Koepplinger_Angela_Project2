CSS Style Requirements

In your project you must use at least 12 unique css properties at least 
once (styles such as font-style and font-family which can be written in 
shorthand will only count as one. Same goes for any other property of the 
same type.). You must also apply style to at least 8 different HTML tags 
using css selectors. You may choose which properties to apply to which tags 
(do what makes sense). You can reuse as many properties as you wish and apply 
them to any tags you wish. Use knowledge from your design classes to make 
something simple. Pick a color scheme. We're not looking for a masterpiece 
here but it shouldn't have bad color contrasts so that it is hard to read or 
use. The point here is that you can use css selectors to apply style and show 
you have some basic understanding of css properties. Your css must be in an 
external style sheet (.css file). At this point keep it simple. We'll get into 
how to style individual tags later.

 Use at least 12 css properties AND style at least 8 HTML tags.

 Your CSS must not cause display or interactivity errors. This means we don't 
 want to see unnecessary horizontal scrolling where interface components are 
 thrown off the screen, thrown out of proper alignment, or buttons become 
 unclickable, etc. Make sure your CSS works properly.*/
